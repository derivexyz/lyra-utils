# lyra-utils
Commonly used libraries in the Lyra protocol. 

The goal is to save dev-time by creating a hardened repo with useful libraries that only need to be audited once, but reused in every protocol upgrade.

## Installation and Build
```shell
git submodule update --init --recursive
forge build
```
